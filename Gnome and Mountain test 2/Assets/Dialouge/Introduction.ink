Hi there! this is the final prototype of the game I was making! 
I've tried my best to get everything working...
...but there are still a lot of bugs!
but I am happy with the final result now though!  
If there is anything I can do better in the future please let me know! :)

Would you like some context on what this game is about?
    *[Yes] -> Main
    *[No] 
    See ya!

->Main
== Main ==
To play the game you must collect one coin for each item to pass through this level 
but when you do collect these coins they will slow you down! 

So just try your best to use your platform skills if you can! 

You can move the arrow keys to move around and space to jump 

Would you like to hear it again?
