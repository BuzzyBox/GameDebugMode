Hi there so the game is finally done!
I've tried my best to get everthing working...
...but I know there's still going to be bugs!

->Main
== Main ==
To play the game you must collect one coin for each item to pass through this level 
but when you do collect these coins they will slow you down! 

so just try your best to use your platform skills if you can! 

you can move the arrow keys to move around and space to jump 

would you like to hear it again?
